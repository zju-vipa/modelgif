![image-20230808004810408](assets/README/image-20230808004810408.png)

## Prepare data and models

Unzip the [reference data(cutmix)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fxbo0eEgWUQasvYamu5qqdOB1Y5ur6kT) to `./data`.

- Raw data can be obtained from [taskonomy official depository](https://github.com/StanfordVL/taskonomy/tree/master/data)

Unzip the [taskonomy models](https://github.com/alexsax/visual-prior/tree/networks) to `\${USER_HOME}\$/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/`.

- [Taskonomy official depository](https://github.com/alexsax/visual-prior/tree/networks)

## Task relatedness estimation

Generate the gradient field for all taskonomy pretrained models with the specified reference data.

```shell
python generate_field.py --exp=1 -r=./result_featuremap_tk_rb -i=reference_data_cutmix_1000 -p=result_cutmix_1000 -g=0
```

- `-r` The root directory where intermediate results are saved.
- `-i` directory of the reference data
- `-p` The file where the intermediate results are saved in the project\'s directory.
- `-g` Select the gpu according to its id.
- `--exp` Calculate the gradient according to what activation target. As the shape of output(NxCxHxW), 
  - 1 Maximize the sum of the maximum values of all feature maps(HxW) in the last layer. 
  - 5 Maximize the sum of the maximum values of all channels in the last layer. 
  - 6 Maximize the total output of all neurons in the last layer.

Calculate the  affinity matrix and verify that the functionality similarity obtained by ModelGiF positively correlates with that from taskonomy.

```shell
python compare_field.py -d=0 -r=./result_featuremap_tk_rb -p=result_cutmix_1000 -g=1
```

- `-d` Distance measurement. 0 Cosine dissimilarity,1 Euclidean distance
- `-r` The root directory where intermediate results are saved. Keep consistent with `generate_field.py`
- `-p` The file where the intermediate results are saved in the project\'s directoryï¼ŒKeep consistent with `generate_field.py`
- `-g` Select the gpu according to its id.

The results are in the last few lines of the `.log` file from `compare_field.py`.

## Visualization

### Visualize affinity matrix

```
python plot_heatmap.py
```

- If you want to visualize the other affinity matrix, please modify the variable `affi` in the `plot_heatmap.py`  manually. 
- The affinity matrix of ModelGiF can be obtained in the last few lines of the `.log` file from `compare_field.py`.

### Similarity tree

```shell
python plot_tree.py
```

- If you want to plot the similarity tree by other affinity matrix, please modify the variable `affi` in the `plot_tree.py`  manually. 
- The affinity matrix of ModelGiF can be obtained in the last few lines of the `.log` file from `compare_field.py`.
